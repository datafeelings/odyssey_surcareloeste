SEPTEMBER 15, 2015

**The West**   
begins right here, 
on the fingers of a hand pointing at the sun on a warm afternoon. It is that house in the distance and that mountain with silhouette of woman that cuts the twilight. It is the Cabo de Gata and Portugal and the Azores. And it never really ends because even the West has a west.

You choose outside because it is no longer worth it. You decide to go west, with the vertigo that gives a single ticket and the freedom not to carry the keys of any particular place. So many months thinking about September 15 and here it is, almost without warning. You imagine that New York will remain as inept as last time, but more expensive.

Things that do not weigh in the backpack include: last minute laughs, clipped maps, good wishes and some "be careful" (your history precedes you). You take little to make room for what remains to be learned. You'll only miss them here, als de més enllà and those from even further away. In a way they will go with you, in some corner of the chest.

You do not know if it will be 3 months or 13, nor how many countries or places will see you go. But that's okay because you're not going to look for it, but find it.

SEPTEMBER 19, 2015  

I'm still recovering from the change of schedule and every night I get into bed with the intention of writing, but before opening the text editor I'm already in a coma, so that today I do not spend the same, I take to get to the Day in the tail of MoMA. Friday afternoons are free starting at 4:00 p.m., but the queue usually goes around the block from long before, so I came at 2:30 p.m. and I am the sixth. It would be fantastic if it were not because right in front of me I have one of those hot dog carts with the diesel engine at full throttle and my nostrils detect scents they did not feel since they were almost blocked with Jakarta traffic. In any case, the situation is not as limit as yesterday, When I arrived at Coney Island exultant of American mysticism and to two minutes of stepping the beach a seagull decided to unload its intestines on me, without warning, in plan French omelette. Anyway.

The trip was good because I wanted to take it as well. I flew first to Oslo and, after 7 hours of stopover and 43 round trips through the terminal, I finally took the flight to New York. During the journey I thought a lot about how many questions I would ask myself this time at JFK customs control, but I did not get nervous for two reasons: I was completely doped (my natural state on any plane) and I have a European passport. The mere fact of being Spanish gives you embarrassing privileges over many other nationalities. The Europeans are shaking their asses around the world at large, in many cases with unorthodox aims, and yet we are not able to respond with humanity to the migratory issue or the refugee crisis. The fashion crisis, Syria, Because in reality the world is in a constant crisis of refugees of which hardly spoken. Ay, but of course, now it knocks on the doors of old Europe and the subject comes out, next to walls, fences and much hypocrisy. Who would say that just a few decades ago it was us, the privileged Europeans, who were massing in the direction of America.

As expected, I entered the United States without major problem. Adam and Nick have treated me very well these days and today I move to Tim and Josh's house. All without leaving Brooklyn. Until a little while ago he had not stepped on Manhattan and, truthfully, did not miss it either. Brooklyn provides enough stimuli for a lifetime: hipster neighborhoods where everything is organic (and expensive), areas of ultra-Orthodox Jews, population districts of all backgrounds, the little big downtown and its boom of skyscrapers, streets where gunfire whistled long ago…

It's still summer in New York. Crude error on my part to think that, outside of July and August, New York lived in a constant snowstorm. No day falls below 30 degrees, so on Thursday I went to the beach. Although its gulls are not very welcoming, Coney Island does not disappoint. I had to bend my neck a lot to see the big buildings where the legal and illegal drug ran in Requiem for a dream. We walked the walk, the beach and the pier, always surrounded by the attractions that give that unreal air to games and dreams.

Thanks to Brooklyn, every day walk for hours through Prospect Park. It does not have the density of recreational areas of Central Park and there is a tenth of people, so it's like being in a forest in the middle of the city. The park invites you to get lost between paths and reflections. Your own name makes you think of perspectives and possibilities. I smile when I think that they are all open because no door is closed.

SEPTEMBER 22, 2015	  

Just a week ago I arrived but, despite the short time that has passed, some aspects of American identity are being revealed with more or less clarity.

One of them, without a doubt, is religion. For an atheist, the number of churches, temples, messages about Christ, offerings of salvation in the afterlife and beatadas several that you can find in a single street is overwhelming. Even when you go to pay you find the eternal message that contains all the tickets, In God We Trust . Interesting conjunction of religion and economic power, as usual. All religions have room and all have a great weight. Some of my friends here are Jews and, although they are secular, they respect and even follow some traditions of Judaism. On Saturday, for example, we went to Adam and Nick's house to celebrate the Jewish New Year or Rosh Hashanah . It is a simple meeting where you put on the boots of delicious food (and all gluten free, It was greatly curtailed) and reflect on what you have learned in the last twelve months. Adam proposed that we draw on a paper the lesson learned in the last year and then explain it to others. Such an idea made me tense because I draw like a 3-year-old. In fact, my fears came true when I glanced at the drawings of others. Some of them seemed to have been taken from the hidden collection of Frida Kahlo, while I had drawn three puppets with legs and arms that inspired more vital anguish than anything else. When it was my turn to explain the lesson I decided to add an extra burden of drama to the story as I subtly folded my drawing and put it in my pocket without teaching it. The strategy worked and nobody asked for my pathetic doodles,

*It did not look like this great example of urban art*


Another daily issue that attracts attention is the obsession for safety and respect for rules. The recommendations on what should and should not be done attack your eyesight wherever you look. The police are omnipresent and almost omnipotent, or so they believe. It is curious the feeling of insecurity that I have when I meet many of them, emerge a haughty attitude that causes me a paradoxical mistrust. Of course, and as many have long been denounced, this does not seem the country of the freedoms that some want to sell. The desire for security has crossed the limit of personal space.

However, the foreigner is accepted with astonishing ease. I imagine that this impression is a result of the absolutely cosmopolitan nature of New York, where you find all the cultures of the world, and that in other parts of the United States the population will be more homogeneous. But there is no doubt that the deep roots of the welcoming country of migrants who have marked their character are everywhere. Throughout New York millions of people arrived for many decades. In fact, it is believed that 50% of the current US population is descended from migrants who arrived in Ellis Island. Another issue would be the interaction between cultures and others. It gives the impression that many people live with their backs to any reality that is not the culture or identity proper to their areas of origin. But without any doubt, Here are all nationalities, all religions, all cultures and all languages. It's a fascinating mix that reminds me of that phrase so widely used by those who criticize Americans for misuse of the word "America" to refer only to their country, rather than to the entire continent. Indeed, America is not a country. And the United States is a nation of nations.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2015	 

The daily dynamics of the inhabitant of any city is similar, whether of a small like Cartagena or a metropolis like New York. You rise, breathe, move, work, eat, enjoy what you can and sleep, not in that order necessarily. You cohabit with thousands of strangers in a relatively small space and you withstand with more or less fortitude different odors, sounds and dislikes. You waste a lot of your time trying to make money and trying to spend it as best you can while craving everything you do not have. The urban life and its insides, what I will tell you that you do not know.

However, one can not deny to New York the ability to overwhelm even the most seasoned urbanite. It is the city par excellence. Odors multiply, sounds deafen and people ... What to say, there are 20 million clusters. Even the concepts of work and leisure take on an inabarcable dimension. Here you can go to the highest job position and have fun, at the same time, in the lowest funds. Nowhere is the power of money and the consequences of not having access to it shown with so little dissimulation. No, no, I was not thinking of releasing an infumable rant about the evils of capitalism.

The other day I was walking around Manhattan at night thinking about the things that would be happening around me at that precise moment, or during that day, or during my stay here. I started investigating and, as expected, many things happen in a city like New York. Neither more nor less, in this precise period of two weeks that I will pass here, 2 people will have died rolled by the meter and 6 will be seriously wounded; 2.1 million tourists will have arrived; Its streets will have seen 8,500 traffic accidents with 30 fatalities (including two cyclists); Its 5,200,000 trees will have eliminated 84 tons of air pollutants; 18 people will have committed suicide; There will have been 1,600 filming like this one I [recorded from the Manhattan Bridge](https://youtu.be/zz-sK3SBM60)...


...there will have been   
- 12 murders and 730 robberies;  
- Courier companies will have received 98,000 fines;  
- Every Central Park street food stall will have had to pay up to $ 8,000 in taxes;  
- The taxis will have invoiced 5,906,000 races;  
- The cars of Uber, 1,700,000;  
- 4,000,000 cartons of Chinese food will have been used;  
- It will have taken 150,000 trees to print the two Sunday editions of the New York Times;  

And there will have been born, no more nor less, 4,581 babies. Four thousand five hundred and eighty-one. All in two weeks.

Otherwise, the buildings under construction will have added some plant, Wall Street will have moved more money than ever and I will end up leaving here, overwhelmed by the inconceivable amount of human beings and acts that exist in a single instant, in a single city.

SEPTEMBER 28, 2015	 

There are days when the Moon wants so much the brightness of the Sun that it aspires to all the star dust that it finds in its passage to look as radiant as possible. "I am now like you," she tells him triumphantly. On those occasions, as the sun nods smilingly at the end of the day, softened by the ingenuity of the satellite without its own brightness, the Moon rises proudly just beyond the horizon, with no more obstacle than clouds that, before show size, immediately decide to retire.

![moon1](https://surcareloeste.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/wpid-dsc_0040.jpg?w=676)

The moment is unique: a hidden beach, full of old bottles that an old factory near expelled to the sea, with an impossible light that emanates of two simultaneous and opposite twils, and with some wonderful beings that in your last day in New York take you to an electrifying place, because they are pure magic inside.

![boat](https://surcareloeste.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/wpid-15-09-28-01-03-24-243_deco.jpg?w=676 "Boat")

However, for the stars today has also been special. The Sun, which has a reputation as naughty throughout the universe, has decided to give a lesson to the fanciful Luna. Without warning, he has hidden for a while behind the Earth, casting a shadow that has slowly obscured the bright face of the satellite, to finish leaving it completely in the dark. The star king, with a game of revolting tongues of fire, has asked the satellite where its great brightness has remained. The moon, red with anger, has answered:

"You think it's funny, but it's unclean." You are wicked for preventing me from giving light to the world!

The Sun, when retiring to give it back its brightness, has settled the matter.

"Everyone cares in his own way. I give them heat, but you give them tides."

SEPTEMBER 30, 2015	  

Even if it's beginning to write by the end, I have no doubt that I will return to New York sooner or later. I'll be back in Brooklyn, actually. The truth is that my mental image of New York is basically Brooklyn, with an overwhelming pegote called Manhattan next door for museums and other tourist attractions.

Each one is made with places that he does not know his way. For me, a city is formed by the people who inhabit it and I like to scrutinize its idiosyncrasy through the people who live in it. After all, the essence that gives off a place mana of those who make it. When you arrive at a new site, you may notice a specific building, a park, a street or a store. Whatever it is, the only certainty is that it is where it is because its inhabitants have built it. Every corner of the city has the indelible mark of the people who work there, who live there or who pass by every day, as if part of their DNA stays among the bricks of the buildings.

![Red house](https://surcareloeste.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/wpid-dsc_0044.jpg?w=676)

*In the bricks, in the gardens, on the sidewalks full of books*

I mentioned the fantastic mix of people, languages and nationalities in Brooklyn. That fascinates me, of course. Also its neighborhoods for all tastes, the Brooklyn Museum and its temporary exhibitions perfectly chosen according to the character of the *borough* , Coney Island, Prospect Park, discarded books at the door of the houses, Park Slope and its shops, bridges, Unexpected visits from Barcelona, architecture... But, without a doubt, what attracts me most from Brooklyn are my friends. The ones I already knew and the new ones. Timothy, Josh, Adam, Nick, Nadia ... They're the ones who made it magical. There have been dinners, ice creams, secluded beaches, parks, eclipses, and a gathering of musicians and friends at Timothy and Josh's house that left me speechless.

I am very excited to explore other areas of the country. I've never been out of New York, and in many places other friends are waiting for me. That's why I do not feel sorry for leaving. That's why and because I know that they, those who make that Brooklyn that attracts me and invites me to spend more and more time, are there. As Timothy told me when he said goodbye, "New York is going nowhere."
